# My-Journey
My journey to become a full fledged programmer and a specialist in machine learning, image processing, NLP, and Data Science

By taking courses and video lectures, I have learned the basics of python. I still have to learn how to use:
Numpy, pytorch, openCV, pandas, matplotlib, tableu and much more.
I have also started to make mini python projects which are reallyyy simple. I have also had my first experience in handling datasets 
from a database and creating certain functions to make use of the data for certain tasks.

lets see what the future holds...
