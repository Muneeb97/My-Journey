Just started learning python and its libraries. This will be the first repository of the many to come..

This will have basic python projects such as calculator based on terminal, basic library code snippets etc. As i go up the ladder and learn more skills and experience, higher level projects will be uploaded as well.


First Branch : Project Euler Problems
